h1. Rails Idle Session Timeout

p. when you deal with privacy related data during a session then it is important to timeout these session since it happens to often that a session stays open. there a lot of examples how to "reuse" an open session.

p. sometimes it is nessecary to have different timeout for different parts of the system. you can do this with

bc. class MyController
  def session_idle_timeout
    Configuration.instance.user_idle_session_timeout
  end
  . . . 
end 

p. or you want to bind your admin session to the IP of the admin:

bc. class MyAdminController
  before_filter :check_session_ip_binding  
  . . . 
end 

p. or you do not want any session timeout

bc. class MyAdminController
  skip_before_filter :check_session_expiry
  . . . 
end 

h2. install

p. in Gemfile add *gem 'ixtlan-session-timeout'*

p. for the configuration add for example in _config/initializers/session-timeout.rb_. without that the default idle timeout is 5 minutes.

bc. Rails.application.config.idle_session_timeout = 30 #minutes

h2. relation to ixtlan gem

p. the ixtlan gem provides a setup generator which adds configuration examples for this gem in _config/initializer/ixtlan.rb_ (the dynamic configuration is part of the ixtlan gem and it is just easier to keep that inside that gem !!!)

h2. relation to ixtlan-audit gem

p. if that gem is present and loaded than any timeout will be log with the help of _Ixtlan::Audit::UserLogger_
